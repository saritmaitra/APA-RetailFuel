This study investigates the asymmetric transmission of exchange rate and crude oil price shocks to U.S. retail gasoline and diesel prices using a Threshold Error Correction Model (TECM). Leveraging monthly data on the crude oil (West Texas Intermediate-WTI), US$ Index, and retail fuel prices (Gasoline & Diesel), we model regime-dependent adjustments based on the sign of disequilibrium. Wald tests indicate no statistically significant long-run asymmetry for either fuel (diesel χ² = 2.50, p = 0.115), yet short-run asymmetry emerges for diesel through differential WTI pass-through (F = 38.13, p < 0.001). While gasoline shows mild error correction (joint ECT χ² = 4.70, p≈0.095), diesel’s error correction is statistically weak, highlighting a divergence in long-run adjustment mechanisms. With an R² of 0.602 and AIC of –940.8, the diesel TECM with short-run asymmetry shows a strong in-sample fit, validating the model’s structure. The contribution lies in disentangling fuel-specific adjustment patterns through a unified TECM framework, offering novel insights into the conditional nature of energy price transmission under asymmetric shocks.
